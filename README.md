# SCSS Grid

This SCSS grid is a a simple and flexible grid system. 

##### Wait what, another CSS grid?!

With millions of different CSS grids out there, it seems unnecessary and redundant to create another one. However, I was unsatisfied with most of the grids I tested and decided it was time to create a grid that fits my needs.

I wanted a responsive & adaptive grid with the ability to freely change the number of columns and the column gutter as well as to nest the columns without adding extra padding or margin to the element.

The implementation is as simple and basic as possible, the compiled and compressed .css file is just **439 Bytes**.

## How does it work?

Based on the number of columns and the column-gutter (or margin) specified in *_grid_config.scss*, we calculate the width of a single column:

`$single-column-width: (100% - ($column-margin * ($column-count - 1))) / $column-count;`

Most grid systems just go with `content-width / column-count` to determine the size of a single column. However, that limits us to using a padding to seperate the columns, which in turn can lead to unwanted effects.

Instead, we take the content-width (100%) and substract the margins corresponding to the number of columns and then divide by the amount of columns.

This leaves us with a width for a single column, which we can then use to calculate the widths of all the other columns:

```
@function calc-column-width($i) {
    @return (($single-column-width * $i) + ($column-margin * ($i - 1)));
}
```

Here, we simply multiply the width of a single column with the desired column-span and then account for the margins.

Finally, we just use the `calc-column-width` method in a simple SASS for-loop to generate the output of the respective class-names:

```
@for $i from 1 through $column-count {
	.col-#{$i} {
		width: calc-column-width($i);
	}
}
```

Thats it. *Science!*

## Using the grid

Always wrap your *.col* classes in a *.row*. 
Do not add more columns to a row than your *column-count*.

```
<div class="row">
	<div class="col-4">.col-4</div>
	<div class="col-4">.col-4</div>
	<div class="col-4">.col-4</div>
</div>
```

## Browser support

This SCSS grid was tested in Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, IE (+9), MS Edge as well as on the iOS Safari and Android Webbrowser. It's pretty good.
